# MailSender
A simple email program useful to avoid to manually send many emails so thousands of copy-pastes


## !!! IMPORTANT !!! - PROJECT UNDER DEVELOPMENT -  
The current (initial) version has been developed for urgent needings and to find out the faster working solution. Quality of the code, together with lots of improvements will be done in the next developments. So please, take it as a STARTING POINT for your own mail sender project, but please, DO NOT GO IN PRODUCTION OR TO AN INTERVIEW WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS!


### THERE ARE A LOT OF HARDCODED STUFF (FILE STRUCTURE/NAMES IN PATHS/IMAGES, TEXT REPLACEMENT...)

### IT HAS BEEN EXPERIMENTED JUST WITH GMAIL (AS SENDER, ALSO OUTLOOK AND YAHOO AS RECEIVER)

### THE PARSING OF THE READ FILE IS NOT FLEXIBLE

### PASSWORD IS IN CLEAR IN THE CONFIGURATION FILE

### THE BACKUP OF THE FAILED EMAILS IS WRITTEN ON A TXT FILE....
